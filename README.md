AI-Enabled IoT Air Pollution Monitoring System

This project is a real-time air quality monitoring system built using Arduino Uno, MQ135 gas sensor, DHT11 temperature & humidity sensor, and Python. It logs data via serial communication and displays it on an LCD. A gas leak detection feature is included to improve home safety. Designed for offline functionality with plans for future web/cloud integration.

## Features
- Real-time air quality monitoring (CO₂, temperature, humidity)
- Data logging using Python scripts
- Gas leak alert system for enhanced safety
- LCD display for local data view
- Designed for offline use without WiFi modules

## Technologies Used
- Arduino IDE (C/C++)
- Python (Serial communication & data logging)
- MQ135, DHT11 sensors
- 16×2 LCD Display
- GitHub for version control

## Future Scope
- Live data visualization on a web dashboard
- Cloud storage integration
- Mobile notification for gas alerts
